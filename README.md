# Guided_Side_App

<!-- The idea has been documented in a short paragraph in MD -->
## Why am I making this?
I have been practicing Mindfulness lately and one of the parts that I need to be more diligant on is practicing gratitude. I am creating a web application where users can logon and add things they are grateful for, such as people, places, memories or whatever and they can write different things about it. Users will be able also see all the things they have previously added and they will be able to add, update and delete their entries.

Privacy is important as the logged in user should feel secure knowing that no other user is able to see their data.
